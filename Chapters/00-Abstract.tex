The purpose for the Lab focuses on acquiring comprehensive skills on operating the low-speed wind tunnel for aerodynamic testing. Key objectives include the understanding of Bernoulli's equation to determine the characteristics of the flow around the airfoil at different angles of attack (AOA). We are going to calculate the pressure at different locations along the airfoil to determine how the lift coefficient, drag coefficient and moment coefficient change when the AOA changes.
