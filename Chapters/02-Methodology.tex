\section{Apparatus}\label{sec:apparatus}
An airfoil is positioned in the wind tunnel test chamber. The airfoil contains pressure taps around its surface connected to three Scanivalve pressure transducers. A computer using data acquisition software collects measurements from the pressure transducers and stores the data in \verb|.csv| files.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:procedures}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the correct motor frequency to use for a wind tunnel velocity of \qtyrange{10}{15}{\meter\per\second}.
    \item Verify the connections to the three Scanivalve pressure transducers.
    \item Using the data acquisition software, calibrate the three Scanivalve pressure transducers.
    \item Set the wind tunnel to \qtyrange{10}{15}{\meter\per\second}.
    \item Set the angle of attack (AoA) to \qty{-4}{\degree}.
    \item Using the data acquisition software, start a file, press the ``Start'' button, press the ``Close File'' button, and then change the AoA according to the lab manual. \label{it:data_aq}
    \item Repeat \autoref{it:data_aq} for AoA \qtylist{-4;0;4;6;8;10;12;14;16}{\degree}. \label{it:repeat}
    \item Repeat %\autoref{it:data_aq} and \autoref{it:repeat} as many times as time allows.
    \item Save the data to a flash drive for post-lab analysis.
\end{enumerate}
