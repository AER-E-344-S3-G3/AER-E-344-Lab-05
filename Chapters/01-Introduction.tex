The Scanivalve DSA 3217, a 16-channel digital pressure transducer pictured in \autoref{fig: scanivalve_top}, calculates the differences in pressure between the input ports and the calibrated reference pressure. In this experiment, the ports of the pressure transducer are connected to pressure taps that line the surface of an airfoil (see \autoref{fig: scanivalve_side}), numbered in the clockwise direction. The Scanivalve pressure transducer is also measuring the pressure at the inlet and outlet of the contraction section.

Using three Scanivalve pressure transducers in conjunction with the data acquisition software, we will measure the pressure around the airfoil (see \autoref{sec:data}). After post-processing using the script in \autoref{sec:code}, we will describe the results of the data in \autoref{cp:results} and \autoref{cp:discussion}.
