The Scanivalve DSA 3217, a 16-channel digital pressure transducer, calculates the differences in pressure between the input ports and the calibrated reference pressure. In this experiment, the ports of the pressure transducer are connected to pressure taps that line the surface of an airfoil, numbered in the clockwise direction. The Scanivalve pressure transducer is also measuring the pressure at the inlet and outlet of the contraction section.

Using 3 Scanivalve pressure transducers in conjunction with the data acquisition software, we will measure the pressure at  increments around the airfoil to quantitatively determine the flow characteristics and compare the results to the theoretical flow solution.
